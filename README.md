ðŸ§® Agentic Tool Calling in LLMs: Enhancing Math Reasoning with a Calculator Agent
Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation and experimental code for the research paper, "Agentic Tool Calling in LLMs: Enhancing Math Reasoning with a Calculator Agent."

The project investigates the performance limitations of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex numerical reasoning tasks (like the GSM8K benchmark) and proposes a dynamic Agentic Tool-Calling System to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that while the model's abstract reasoning is strong, its failure lies in deterministic numerical execution, a gap which an external calculator tool fills effectively.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Core Model: Uses the Meta LLaMa 3.1 8B Base Model as the central reasoning engine.

Tool Integration: Implements a robust, safe, AST-parsed Python calculator tool for deterministic, secure computation.

Protocol: Employs a ReAct-style (Reasoning and Acting) framework and a custom <CALC>...</CALC> communication protocol to manage tool calls within the model's chain of thought.

Two-Phase Strategy: Utilizes a Plan-and-Execute methodology to ensure the model structures complex, multi-step problems before performing calculations.

ðŸ“ˆ Experimental Results (Summary)
The experiments confirm the significant value of tool augmentation, showing that the LLM's primary failure in math is execution, not conceptual thought.

| Experiment | Model Variant | Dataset | Tool Use | Accuracy (%) | Performance Gain |
| Baseline | LLaMa 3.1 8B Base | GSM8K | CoT Only | 15% | - |
| ReAct Agent | LLaMa 3.1 8B Base | GSM8K | Tool-Augmented | 50% | +35% Absolute |
| Direct Call | LLaMa 3.1 8B Base | Custom Math | Tool-Augmented | 80% | +32% (vs. 48% CoT) |
